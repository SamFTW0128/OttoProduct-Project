It is a practice on deep learning that I did following Mr. Sungkim's Tutorial on YouTube.
Here is a specific link to that episode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvNdl7yg4Pg&list=PLlMkM4tgfjnJ3I-dbhO9JTw7gNty6o_2m&index=9
Many thanks to Mr. Sungkim for such an awesome video.

Disclaimer: Code is not perfect, this is a practice that I thought was pretty impressive by my own standards, was a pretty great experience
